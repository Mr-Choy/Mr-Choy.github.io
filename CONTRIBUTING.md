We accept pull requests which will undergo a review of at least 1 of this project's contributors. These will be checked for validity of both, correctness and coding standards. If an issue will arise, you will be informed with a detailed explanation of what changes are needed in order for your pull request to be included in the project.

Please **do NOT** submit pull requests with translations directly inside the code. You can create new language constants in the [`GameEngine/Lang/en.php`](https://github.com/Shadowss/TravianZ/tree/master/GameEngine/Lang) file + your own language file respectively, then use these everywhere in the code.

If you would like to transfer your knowledge about Travian, including gameplay, mathematical equations used to calculate things inside or strategies, please don't hesitate to contribute either directly to [our Wiki](https://github.com/Shadowss/TravianZ/wiki) (if you have permissions) or by creating a new issue / pull request.
